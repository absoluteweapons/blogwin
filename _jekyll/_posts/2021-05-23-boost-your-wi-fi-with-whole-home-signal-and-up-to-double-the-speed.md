## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why Would I Do This?

You‚Äôre probably here because you‚Äôre paying for speedy Internet and it‚Äôs shit because the cheap-ass router your ISP gave you is...well...cheap-ass.

In the furthest corner of my house from our Virgin Hub 4 or 5 or 6 or whatever, I got some f*ing impressive speed differences with a new router. To test, I put the laptop on the floor and connected to the our Virgin Hub‚Äôs Wi-Fi, then to the new router‚Äôs Wi-Fi in turn running tests on [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/ "Test your Internet speed at speedtest.net").

We‚Äôre on Virgin cable at **110 Mb/s**.

**Original Virgin Hub - 34 Mb/s**

To be fair, this is not bad. It‚Äôs about 69% speed loss. Virgin seem to have updated their Hub software (when we first got the Hub, one wall would kill the connection).

**New ASUS Router - 56 Mb/s**

However, without _any_ extra setup you can see the ASUS router adds just over **20 Mb/s** to the connection. To put that into perspective, that‚Äôs a full copper broadband connection.

That‚Äôs why you would do this ‚ò∫Ô∏è

## üò≤ How Can I Achieve This Magical Speed Improvement?

### Step One

#### Buy the Router

The router you need is the [ASUS RT-AC86U](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075WFL15D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B075WFL15D&linkCode=as2&tag=jevawin-21&linkId=d40a3435a8145e383ae0899dfbc8d28e "ASUS RT-AC86U router on Amazon").

It‚Äôs usually ¬£130 on Amazon (although I've seen it around ¬£150) and if you use my links I‚Äôll get 12% commission üòä but if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, go for it!

It looks like this.

### Step Two

#### Plug the Router In

When your router arrives, whip everything out of the box and start plugging in.

1. Screw in the 3 antennae - point them all forwards for now, we‚Äôll get to this later üôÇ.
2. Plug the router into power.
3. Take the Ethernet cable (looks like a giant black telephone cable) and plug one end into one of (1-4, doesn‚Äôt matter which) the **LAN** ports of your current router (from your Internet provider), and the other end into the **WAN** (blue) port of the new ASUS router.

It should look like this:

![A Virgin Media Hub with a black Ethernet cable coming out of one of the yellow LAN ports. The other end of the cable is plugged into the blue WAN port of the ASUS router.](/assets/images/uploads/img_0567.jpeg "Connecting the ASUS router")

Where the black cable is plugged into a yellow LAN port of my Virgin modem-router and the blue WAN port of the ASUS router.

Once it‚Äôs plugged in, press the power button on the new router (red arrow; all the lights on the front should start flashing).

> **Explanation for nerds:** LAN = Local Area Network. WAN = Wide Area Network (e.g. the Internet). Your ISP‚Äôs modem-router shares the Internet via Wi-Fi (for now) and those 4 LAN ports. We‚Äôre using a LAN port to provide Internet to the new router, but so that the new router recognises it as the Internet we‚Äôre going into the WAN (Internet) port of the new router.
>
> The reason we need to go via your ISP‚Äôs device is that it‚Äôs a **modem** as well, meaning it gets the Internet via cable (Virgin) or a phone line (BT, Sky, TalkTalk, etc.).

### Step Three

#### Connect to the Router

Right now your new router is powering on for the first time. It‚Äôs getting the Internet from your ISP‚Äôs modem-router, and it‚Äôs made its own new Wi-Fi network for you.

It‚Äôs time to configure it.

1. Open your laptop or a good-sized tablet (preferably not a phone, this is harder on a tiny screen).
2. Look for a Wi-Fi network called **ASUS_XX**

   ![An image of a list of Wi-Fi networks on a macOS computer; accessible by clicking the settings icon in the top right or the screen](/assets/images/uploads/827e1e49-718e-4b1a-aaf5-36a3dc24c164.png "macOS Wi-Fi list")
   * On a Mac click the little dials icon in the top right and go to Wi-Fi. On a PC it‚Äôs the wireless icon in the bottom right. [Instructions for a PC here.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/connect-to-a-wi-fi-network-in-windows-10-1f881677-b569-0cd5-010d-e3cd3579d263 "How to connect to WiFi in Windows 10")![An image of the icons in the Windows taskbar that open the Wi-Fi networks list. One looks like a globe. One like a computer screen. One like a Wi-Fi symbol or radio waves.](/assets/images/uploads/6ef6a0c7-ad00-42e3-b803-6f68c062adc5.png "Windows Wi-Fi")
3. Connect to either the 5G or 2G network - whichever has the strongest signal. If they‚Äôre the same choose 5G.

> **Explanation for nerds:** 5G, or 5GHz, is a faster Wi-Fi signal because its radio wavelength is shorter, meaning it can carry more data. However, that also means it gets blocked more easily (e.g. by walls). 2G, or 2.4GHz, is a slower signal but travels further and better through walls and other obstacles. However, 2.4GHZ is used by lots of other devices like baby monitors, garage door openers. You shouldn‚Äôt need to worry though, because this new router automatically manages which one your devices use.

### Step Four

#### Configure the Router

1. While on your **new router‚Äôs Wi-Fi**: open a web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
2. Visit this URL: [http://192.168.1.1/](http://192.168.1.1/ "Router configuration page")
3. You should be presented with this screen: ![The first screen of a new ASUS router‚Äôs configuration website, asking a user if they wish to create a new network or go into advanced settings.](/assets/images/uploads/screenshot-2021-05-23-at-11-01-07.png "ASUS router welcome screen")
4. Hit **Create A New Network**

##### Decision Time!

![](/assets/images/uploads/screenshot-2021-05-23-at-11-02-47.png)

**Easy Route**

If you just want to be done or test it out, then come up with a brand new Wi-Fi network name [(be creative)](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=funny+wifi+names&source=lmns&bih=803&biw=1261&client=safari&hl=en-GB&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8-qSOoIDxAhVC0RoKHUeQBGYQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA "Funny Wi-Fi names"); enter your own password [(be secure)](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator "Free strong password generator from LastPass"); and press **Apply**

_Don‚Äôt tick **Separate 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz** unless you know why you‚Äôd want to do that_.

![](/assets/images/uploads/screenshot-2021-05-23-at-11-03-00.png)

On the next screen, come up with your own login name and admin password (you‚Äôll use these if you log into the router to change settings again).

**What Happens Now?**

Now your original modem-router from your ISP is still giving out the Internet via its Wi-Fi, but your new fancy ASUS router is also giving out the Internet on a different network name.

Connect to the new network with the cool name you gave it. Test your speeds.

**Getting the Most Speed**

Remember those antennae you screwed in? One of the nifty things about the ASUS router is it has those three _directional_ antennae.

Play around trying to point them where you want the best Wi-Fi and run speed tests to get the strongest connection.

**You Could Stop Here**

But you shouldn‚Äôt. For a couple of reasons:

1. You‚Äôll have to connect every device in your home to the new Wi-Fi to make the most of it.
2. You‚Äôve just created another **competing network**, i.e. your new Wi-Fi is competing with your original one for bandwidth and they might interfere with each other.

To put 2 into perspective, remember earlier I said I got **34 Mb/s** with our Virgin router in the corner of the house, **56 Mb/S** with the new ASUS router?

Turning off the Virgin router‚Äôs Wi-Fi squeezes out an additional **4 Mb/s** for a total of **60 Mb/s**.

![](/assets/images/uploads/screenshot-2021-05-23-at-12-11-50.png)

That might not seem much but if you have a lot of devices simultaneously connected and downloading, that impact will be greater.

**Two More Steps**

Now that you‚Äôve got the router and it‚Äôs working, there are two more things to do to for the best setup:

1. Disable WiFi on your ISP‚Äôs modem-router.
2. Set your new router‚Äôs Wi-Fi name and password to match your ISP‚Äôs.

You could do neither; 1 alone; or 1 and 2 together.

Here‚Äôs a quick explanation of each:

**Disable Wi-Fi on Your ISP‚Äôs Modem-router**

This shouldn‚Äôt take long but how to do it varies by ISP. With Virgin‚Äôs Hub I had an option called ‚ÄúModem Mode‚Äù, which disabled it. With my grandad‚Äôs Plusnet router I just had to go into Wi-Fi settings and switch it off. I can‚Äôt give you exact instructions but I can guide you.

**Set Your New Router‚Äôs Wi-Fi Name and Password to Match Your ISP‚Äôs**

This is easily the most useful step. If you do this then every device currently on the Internet in your house will automatically connect to the new router. It saves you having to reconnect everything one by one to a new Wi-Fi (for us, this meant a bunch of Sonos speakers, a smart meter, Google Home, 2 laptops, 2 phones, an Apple Watch...you get the picture).

But it‚Äôs also slightly trickier to do and again, exactly how depends on your current device. I‚Äôll guide you though using my Virgin Hub as an example.

### Step Five
