[Skip to instructions](#step-one "Skip to instructions")

### Step One

#### Buy the Router

The router you need is the [ASUS RT-AC86U](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075WFL15D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B075WFL15D&linkCode=as2&tag=jevawin-21&linkId=d40a3435a8145e383ae0899dfbc8d28e "ASUS RT-AC86U Router on Amazon").

Itâ€™s Â£130 on Amazon and if you use my links Iâ€™ll get 12% commission ðŸ˜Š but if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, go for it!

### Step Two

#### Plug the Router In

When your router arrives, whip everything out of the box and start plugging in.

1. Screw in the 3 antennae - point them all forwards for now, weâ€™ll get to this later ðŸ™‚.
2. Plug the router into power.
3. Take the Ethernet cable (looks like a giant black telephone cable) and plug one end into one of (1-4, doesnâ€™t matter which) the **LAN** ports of your current router (from your Internet provider), and the other end into the **WAN** (blue) port of the new ASUS router.

It should look like this:

![A Virgin Media Hub with a black Ethernet cable coming out of one of the yellow LAN ports. The other end of the cable is plugged into the blue WAN port of the ASUS router.](/assets/images/uploads/img_0567.jpeg "Connecting the ASUS router")

Where the black cable is plugged into a yellow LAN port of my Virgin modem-router and the blue WAN port of the ASUS router.

Once itâ€™s plugged in, press the power button on the new router (red arrow; all the lights on the front should start flashing).

> **Explanation for nerds:** LAN = Local Area Network. WAN = Wide Area Network (e.g. the Internet). Your ISPâ€™s modem-router shares the Internet via Wi-Fi (for now) and those 4 LAN ports. Weâ€™re using a LAN port to provide Internet to the new router, but so that the new router recognises it as the Internet weâ€™re going into the WAN (Internet) port of the new router.
>
> The reason we need to go via your ISPâ€™s device is that itâ€™s a **modem** as well, meaning it gets the Internet via cable (Virgin) or a phone line (BT, Sky, TalkTalk, etc.).

### Step Three

#### Configure to the Router

Right now your new router is powering on for the first time. Itâ€™s getting the Internet from your ISPâ€™s modem-router, and itâ€™s made its own new Wi-Fi network for you.

Itâ€™s time to configure it.

1. Open your laptop or a good-sized tablet (preferably not a phone, this is harder on a tiny screen).
2. Look for a Wi-Fi network called **ASUS_XX**

   ![An image of a list of Wi-Fi networks on a macOS computer; accessible by clicking the settings icon in the top right or the screen](/assets/images/uploads/screenshot-2021-05-23-at-10-59-51.png "macOS Wi-Fi list")
   * On a Mac click the little dials icon in the top right and go to Wi-Fi. On a PC itâ€™s the wireless icon in the bottom right. [Instructions for a PC here.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/connect-to-a-wi-fi-network-in-windows-10-1f881677-b569-0cd5-010d-e3cd3579d263 "How to connect to WiFi in Windows 10")![An image of the icons in the Windows taskbar that open the Wi-Fi networks list. One looks like a globe. One like a computer screen. One like a Wi-Fi symbol or radio waves.](/assets/images/uploads/6ef6a0c7-ad00-42e3-b803-6f68c062adc5.png "Windows Wi-Fi")
   * Connect to either the 5G or 2G network - whichever has the strongest signal. If theyâ€™re the same choose 5G.

> **Explanation for nerds:** 5G, or 5GHz, is a faster Wi-Fi signal because its radio wavelength is shorter, meaning it can carry more data. However, that also means it gets blocked more easily (e.g. by walls). 2G, or 2.4GHz, is a slower signal but travels further and better through walls and other obstacles. However, 2.4GHZ is used by lots of other devices like baby monitors, garage door openers. You shouldnâ€™t need to worry though, because this new router automatically manages which one your devices use.

3. Open a web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
4. Visit this URL: [http://192.168.1.1/](http://192.168.1.1/ "Router configuration page")
5. You should be presented with this screen: ![The first screen of a new ASUS routerâ€™s configuration website, asking a user if they wish to create a new network or go into advanced settings.](/assets/images/uploads/screenshot-2021-05-23-at-11-01-07.png "ASUS router welcome screen")
6. Hit **Create A New Network**

##### Decision Time!

**Easy Route**

If you just want to be done or test it out, then come up with a brand new Wi-Fi network name [(be creative)](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=funny+wifi+names&source=lmns&bih=803&biw=1261&client=safari&hl=en-GB&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8-qSOoIDxAhVC0RoKHUeQBGYQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA "Funny Wi-Fi names"); enter your own password [(be secure)](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator "Free strong password generator from LastPass"); and press **Apply**

_Donâ€™t tick **Separate 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz** unless you know why youâ€™d want to do that_.

**What Happens Now?**

Now your original modem-router from your ISP is still giving out the Internet via its Wi-Fi, but your new fancy ASUS router is also giving out the Internet on a different network name.

Connect to the new network with the cool name you gave it.
