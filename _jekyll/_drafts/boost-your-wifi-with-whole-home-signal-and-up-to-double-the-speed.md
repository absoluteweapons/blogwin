[Skip to instructions](#step-one "Skip to instructions")

### Step One

#### Buy the Router

The router you need is the [ASUS RT-AC86U](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075WFL15D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B075WFL15D&linkCode=as2&tag=jevawin-21&linkId=d40a3435a8145e383ae0899dfbc8d28e "ASUS RT-AC86U Router on Amazon").

Itâ€™s Â£130 on Amazon and if you use my links Iâ€™ll get 12% commission ðŸ˜Š but if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, go for it!

### Step Two

#### Plug the Router In

When your router arrives, whip everything out of the box and start plugging in.

1. Plug the router into power.
2. Take the Ethernet cable (looks like a giant black telephone cable) and plug one end into one of (1-4, doesnâ€™t matter which) the **LAN** ports of your current router (from your Internet provider), and the other end into the **WAN** (blue) port of the new ASUS router.

It should look like this:

Where the black cable is plugged into a yellow LAN port of my Virgin modem-router and the blue WAN port of the ASUS router.

Once itâ€™s plugged in, press the power button on the new router (red arrow; all the lights on the front should start flashing).

> **Explanation for nerds:** LAN = Local Area Network. WAN = Wide Area Network (e.g. the Internet). Your ISPâ€™s modem-router shares the Internet via Wi-Fi (for now) and those 4 LAN ports. Weâ€™re using a LAN port to provide Internet to the new router, but so that the new router recognises it as the Internet weâ€™re going into the WAN (Internet) port of the new router.
>
> The reason we need to go via your ISPâ€™s device is that itâ€™s a **modem** as well, meaning it gets the Internet via cable (Virgin) or a phone line (BT, Sky, TalkTalk, etc.).

### Step Three

#### Configure to the Router

Right now your new router is powering on for the first time. Itâ€™s getting the Internet from your ISPâ€™s modem-router, and itâ€™s made its own new Wi-Fi network for you.

Itâ€™s time to configure it.

1. Open your laptop or a good-sized tablet (preferably not a phone, this is harder on a tiny screen).
2. Look for a Wi-Fi network called **ASUS_XX**

   * On a Mac click the little dials icon in the top right and go to Wi-Fi. On a PC itâ€™s the wireless icon in the bottom right.

   * Connect to either the 5G or 2G network - whichever has the strongest signal. If theyâ€™re the same choose 5G.

> **Explanation for nerds:** 5G is a faster Wi-Fi signal because its radio wavelength is shorter, meaning it can carry more data. However, that also means itâ€™s more prone to interference - e.g. from walls, metal, etc. Think of it like this: 5G or 5GHz is FM radio. 2G or 2GHz is AM radio.
