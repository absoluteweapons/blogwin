### Step One

#### Buy the Router

The router you need is the [ASUS RT-AC86U](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075WFL15D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B075WFL15D&linkCode=as2&tag=jevawin-21&linkId=d40a3435a8145e383ae0899dfbc8d28e "ASUS RT-AC86U Router on Amazon").

Itâ€™s Â£130 on Amazon and if you use my links Iâ€™ll get 12% commission ðŸ˜Š but if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, go for it!

### Step Two

#### Plug the Router In

When your router arrives, whip everything out of the box and start plugging in.

1. Plug the router into power.
2. Take the Ethernet cable (looks like a giant black telephone cable) and plug one end into one of (1-4, doesnâ€™t matter which) the **LAN** ports of your current router (from your Internet provider), and the other end into the **WAN** (blue) port of the new ASUS router.

It should look like this:

Where the black cable is plugged into a yellow LAN port of my Virgin modem-router and the blue WAN port of the ASUS router.

> **Explanation for nerds:** LAN = Local Area Network. WAN = Wide Area Network (e.g. the Internet). Your ISPâ€™s modem-router shares the Internet via WiFi (for now) and those 4 LAN ports. Weâ€™re using a LAN port to provide Internet to the new router, but so that the new router recognises it as the Internet weâ€™re going into the WAN (Internet) port of the new router.

> The reason we need to go via your ISPâ€™s device is that itâ€™s a **modem** as well, meaning it gets the Internet via cable (Virgin) or a phone line (BT, Sky, TalkTalk, etc.).
