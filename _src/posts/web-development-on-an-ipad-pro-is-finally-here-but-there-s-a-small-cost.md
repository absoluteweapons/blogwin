Say whaaa!? Yep. You can build websites on an iPad.

In fact, you’ve been able to build them on an iPad for a while (using [Code Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server "Code Server - VS Code-based browser-accessible IDE")) but it’s been fiddly to set up and (for me) a little temperamental.

Now however, GitHub have made their own browser-based implementation of VS Code called [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces "GitHub Codespaces: browser-based implementation of VS Code") and it works…really quite well!
