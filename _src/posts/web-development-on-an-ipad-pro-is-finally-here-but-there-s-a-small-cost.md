Say whaaa!? Yep. You can build websites on an iPad.

In fact, you’ve been able to build them on an iPad for a while (using [Code Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server "Code Server - VS Code-based browser-accessible IDE")) but it’s been fiddly to set up and (for me) a little temperamental.

Now however, GitHub have made their own browser-based implementation of VS Code called [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces "GitHub Codespaces: browser-based implementation of VS Code") and it works…really quite well!

However, there’s a catch. 

# Wait for free, or pay

## Option One: Wait for free

From what I can tell it looks like there’ll be a free version - but you need to join a waitlist:

I was on it for a few months and didn’t get an invite.

## Option Two: Pay

If you can’t wait you can pay to access it now. This requires you to convert your GitHub account to an organisation (or set up a new organisation).

It costs **$4 a month** for the base GitHub Team organisation, **plus $0.18 per hour of use** for the base GitHub Codespaces plan.

[Pricing for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces#codespaces-pricing "Pricing for GitHub Codespaces")

### Step One: Set up an organisation

Navigate to [**Organisations**](https://github.com/settings/organizations "GitHub organisations") in your GitHub account area and either upgrade your account to an organisation, or set up a new organisation.

> Tip: I set up a new organisation and regretted it. I had to move my repositories into the organisation and reconnect all apps and services. I wish I’d upgraded my account instead.
